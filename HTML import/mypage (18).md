##### Learning Objectives

1. Define the criminal act element.
2. Identify three requirements of criminal act.
3. Describe an exception to the criminal act element.

5. Distinguish between actual and constructive possession.
6. Identify the criminal intent element required when possession is the criminal act.

## The Criminal Act

**Criminal act**, or _**actus reus**,_ is generally defined as the act or omission  (failure to act) prohibited or required by a given jurisdiction's laws. The criminal statute, or case in jurisdictions that allow common-law crimes, describes the criminal act element.

## The Requirement of Voluntariness

One requirement of criminal act is that the defendant perform it _voluntarily_. In other words, the defendant must _control_ the act. It would not serve the policy of specific deterrence to punish the defendant for irrepressible acts. The Model Penal Code gives the following examples of acts that are not voluntary and, therefore, not criminal: reflexes, convulsions, bodily movements during unconsciousness or sleep, conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion, or a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual. [[1|1]](Courses/Concordia_University_Wisconsin/JPP_207_Substantive_Criminal_Law/04:_The_Elements_of_a_Crime/4.03:_Actus_ReusThe_Criminal_Act#fn1 "4.3: Actus Reus—The Criminal Act") 

_One voluntary act_ is enough to fulfill the voluntary act requirement. Thus if a _voluntary_ act is followed by an _involuntary_ one, the court may still impose criminal liability depending on the circumstances. 

##### Example \(\PageIndex{1}\): Involuntary and Noncriminal Act

Perry is hypnotized at the local county fair. The hypnotist directs Perry to smash a banana cream pie into his girlfriend Shelley’s face.

Smashing a pie into a person’s face is probably _battery_ in most states, but Perry did not commit the act _voluntarily_, so he should not be convicted of a crime. Punishing Perry for battery would not specifically deter Perry from performing the act again while hypnotized because he is not in control of his behavior when experiencing this mental state.

##### Example \(\PageIndex{2}\): Voluntary Act Followed by an Involuntary Act

Timothy attends a party at a friend’s house and consumes several glasses of red wine. Timothy then attempts to drive his vehicle home. While driving, Timothy passes out at the wheel and hits another vehicle, killing its occupant. Timothy can probably be convicted of one or more crimes in this situation. Timothy’s acts of drinking several glasses of wine and then driving a vehicle are _voluntary_. Thus even though Timothy got into a car accident while unconscious, his involuntary act was preceded by conscious, controllable, and voluntary action. A punishment in this instance could _specifically deter_ Timothy from drinking and driving on another occasion and is appropriate based on the circumstances.

Case in Point: Case Summary

In  _Govt. of Virgin Islands v. Smith_, [278 F.2d 169](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7293081512592321299&hl=en&as_sdt=6,50 "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7293081512592321299&hl=en&as_sdt=6,50") (3rd Cir. 1960), Hugh Smith appealed a conviction for involuntary manslaughter for killing a pedestrian on a sidewalk when his car jumped a curb while driving in "a grossly negligence manner." Smith argued that he could not be criminally responsible because he was unconscious as a result of an epileptic seizure at the time of the accident; thus, the way in which he was driving was not voluntary.

The court observed, however, that being unconscious from an epileptic seizure does not automatically excuse the conduct. Responsibility may depend on circumstances such as whether Smith had a reason to anticipate having a seizure when he voluntarily started operating the vehicle. Further, what Smith knew or anticipated must be compared to what a reasonably prudent person in his shoes under the same circumstances would or would not do.

## Status as a Criminal Act

Generally, a defendant’s **status** in society is not a criminal act. Status is _who_ the defendant is, not what the defendant _does_. Similar to punishment for an involuntary act, when the government punishes an individual for status, it is essentially targeting that individual for circumstances that are outside his or her control. This punishment may be cruel and unusual pursuant to the Eighth Amendment if it is disproportionate to the defendant’s behavior.

##### Example \(\PageIndex{3}\)

Refer to [Example 4.3.2](Courses/Concordia_University_Wisconsin/JPP_207_Substantive_Criminal_Law/04:_The_Elements_of_a_Crime/4.03:_Actus_ReusThe_Criminal_Act#Example_.5C\(.5CPageIndex.7B2.7D.5C\):_Voluntary_Act_Followed_by_an_Involuntary_Act "4.3: Actus Reus—The Criminal Act") above in which Timothy. Assume that in addition to driving under the influence of alcohol when he killed his occupant, and that a state  had a statute that criminalized driving under the influence and a statute that criminalized being an alcoholic.

Being an alcoholic would be a crime of status; the statute criminalizes a condition (not being able to control his drinking), but the statute does not criminalize a voluntary act.

However, the statute criminalizing driving under the influence would be constitutional, even if Timothy is an alcoholic, because the statute criminalizes the act of driving while intoxicated, a  _voluntary_ act. The state has legitimate interest in preventing alcohol-related acts that can injure or kill Timothy or another person, even if Timothy's status as an alcoholic makes it difficult to control his drinking. 

If the defendant can control the actions at issue in spite of his or her status, the defendant’s conduct can be constitutionally criminalized and punished pursuant to the Eighth Amendment.

Cases in Point: Case Summaries

In _Powell v. Texas_, [392 U.S. 514](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3324564444975817112&q=Powell+v.+Texas&hl=en&as_sdt=2,5 "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3324564444975817112&q=Powell+v.+Texas&hl=en&as_sdt=2,5") (1968), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the defendant’s conviction for “drunk in public,” in spite of the defendant’s **status** as an alcoholic. The Court held that it is difficult _but not impossible_ for an alcoholic to resist the urge to drink, so the behavior the statute criminalized was voluntary. Also, the Court ruled that the state has an interest in treating alcoholism and preventing alcohol-related crimes that could injure the defendant and others. Pursuant to _Powell_, statutes that criminalize _voluntary acts_ that _arise_ from status are constitutional under the Eighth Amendment.  
  
In _Robinson v. California_, [370 U.S. 660](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3358010003227436496&q=Robinson+v.+California&hl=en&as_sdt=2,5 "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3358010003227436496&q=Robinson+v.+California&hl=en&as_sdt=2,5") (1962), the U.S. Supreme Court held that it is unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment pursuant to the Eighth Amendment to punish an individual for the **status** of being a drug addict—even if the drugs to which the defendant is addicted are _illegal_. The Court compared drug addiction to an illness, such as leprosy or venereal disease. According to the Court, punishing a defendant for a condition not only is inhumane but also does _not_ specifically deter, similar to a punishment for an involuntary act.

## Thoughts as Criminal Acts

Thoughts are a part of [**criminal intent**](Courses/Concordia_University_Wisconsin/JPP_207_Substantive_Criminal_Law/04:_The_Elements_of_a_Crime/4.04:_Mens_ReaCriminal_Intent "4.4: Mens Rea—Criminal Intent") , _not_ the  **criminal act**. Thoughts cannot be criminalized.

##### Example \(\PageIndex{4}\)

Brianna, a house cleaner, fantasizes about killing her elderly client Phoebe and stealing all her jewelry. Brianna writes her thoughts in a diary, documenting how she intends to rig the gas line so that gas is pumped into the house all night while Phoebe is sleeping. Brianna includes the date that she wants to kill Phoebe in her most recent diary entry. As Brianna leaves Phoebe’s house, her diary accidentally falls out of her purse. Later, Phoebe finds the diary on the floor and reads it. Phoebe calls the police, gives them Brianna’s diary, and insists they arrest Brianna for attempted murder.

Although Brianna’s murder plot is sinister and is documented in her diary, an arrest is improper in this case. Brianna cannot be punished for her _thoughts alone_. If Brianna took substantial steps toward killing Phoebe, an attempted murder charge might be appropriate. However, at this stage, Brianna is only _planning_ a crime, not _committing_ a crime. Phoebe may be able to go to court and get a restraining order against Brianna to prevent her from carrying out her murder plot, but Brianna cannot be incapacitated by arrest and prosecution for attempted murder in this case.

## Omissions: Failures to Act

An exception to the requirement of a criminal act element is an act of **omission** (i.e., failure to act). Criminal prosecution for a _failure to act_ is rare because the government is reluctant to compel individuals to put themselves in harm’s way. However, under certain specific circumstances, omission to act can be criminalized.

An omission to act can lead to criminal liability only when a legal  _duty to act_ exists. For example, in Wisconsin [Wisconsin](https://wilawlibrary.gov/jury/criminal/instruction.php?n=905) [Criminal Jury Instruction 905](https://wilawlibrary.gov/jury/criminal/instruction.php?n=905) , a defendant can be criminally liability for an omission when:

- the law created a duty to act;
- the defendant has knowledge of facts giving rise to the duty;
- the defendant has the physical ability to act as the duty requires; and
- the defendant failed to act as the legal duty requires.

This legal duty to act becomes an **element** of the crime, and the prosecution must prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, along with proving the defendant’s inaction under the circumstances. Failure or omission to act is only criminal in three situations: (1) when there is a **statute** that creates a legal duty to act, (2) when there is a **contract** that creates a legal duty to act, or (3) when there is a **special relationship between the parties** that creates a legal duty to act. Legal duties to act vary from state to state and from state to federal.

### Duty to Act Based on a Statute

When a duty to act is statutory, it usually concerns a government interest that is _paramount_. Some common examples of statutory duties to act include the duty to file tax returns ( [26 U.S.C. § 7203](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7203 "https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7203")); the duty to report child abuse or neglect ( [Wis. Stat. § 48.981(2)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/48/xxi/981/2 "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/48/xxi/981/2")); and the duty to aid a crime victim or report a crime ( [Wis. Stat. § 940.34](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/940/ii/34 "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/940/ii/34")).

##### Example \(\PageIndex{5}\): Statutory Duty to Act in Wisconsin

[Wis. Stat. § 948.21(2)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/948.21\(2\) "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/948.21(2)") makes it a felony for "[a]ny person responsible for a child’s welfare [the](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/948.01\(3\) "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/948.01(3)") [child’s parent; stepparent; guardian; foster parent; an employee of a public or private residential home, institution, or agency; other person legally responsible for the child’s welfare in a residential setting; or a person employed by one legally responsible for the child’s welfare to exercise temporary control or care for the child](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/948.01\(3\) "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/948.01(3)") who, through his or her action or failure to take action, for reasons other than poverty, negligently [to fail] to provide any of the following, so as to seriously endanger the physical, mental, or emotional health of the child:

1. Necessary care.
2. Necessary food.
3. Necessary clothing.
4. Necessary medical care.
5. Necessary shelter.
6. Education ...
7. The protection from exposure to the distribution or manufacture of controlled substances ...

##### Example \(\PageIndex{6}\): Statutory Duty to Act in Wisconsin

[Wis. Stat. § 940.291](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/940.291 "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/940.291") requires law enforcement officers (1) to render aid to others and (2) to prevent other officers from failing to render that aid. 

1. Any peace officer, while acting in the course of employment or under the authority of employment, who intentionally fails to render or make arrangements for any necessary first aid for any person in his or her actual custody is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor if bodily harm results from the failure. This subsection applies whether the custody is lawful or unlawful and whether the custody is actual or constructive. A violation for intentionally failing to render first aid under this subsection applies only to first aid which the officer has the knowledge and ability to render.  
     
2. Any peace officer who knowingly permits another person to violate sub. (1), while acting in the course of employment or under the authority of employment, is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.

##### Example \(\PageIndex{7}\): Statutory Duty to Act in Wisconsin

[Wis. Stat. § 940.34(2)(a)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/940.34\(2\)\(a\) "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/940.34(2)(a)") creates a duty to provide assistance or summon law enforcement officers or others for assistance when the person "knows that a crime is being committed and that a victim is exposed to bodily harm." However, [Wis. Stat. § 940.34(2)(d)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/940.34\(2\)\(d\) "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/940.34(2)(d)") notes that this duty does not exist if complying with the duty would place the person in danger or interfere with duties already owed to others, or if assistance is already being summoned or provided by others.

#### Good Samaritan Statutes 

At common law, it was not criminal to stand by and refuse to help someone in danger. But many states like Wisconsin have statutes that  _supersede_ the common law. by enacting **Good Samaritan statutes**, which provide immunity from civil liability for an actor who happens to cause an injury while rendering emergency care.

##### Example \(\PageIndex{8}\): Good Samaritan Statute in Wisconsin

[Wis. Stat. § 895.48(1)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/895.48\(1\) "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/895.48(1)") states that "Except [for certain healthcare providers], any person who renders emergency care at the scene of any emergency or accident in good faith shall be immune from civil liability for his or her acts or omissions in rendering such emergency care.

This statute is intended to encourage people to comply with the duty to aid in  [Wis. Stat. § 940.34(2)(a)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/940.34\(2\)\(a\) "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/940.34(2)(a)") ( [see Example 4.3.7](Courses/Concordia_University_Wisconsin/JPP_207_Substantive_Criminal_Law/04:_The_Elements_of_a_Crime/4.03:_Actus_ReusThe_Criminal_Act#Example_.5C\(.5CPageIndex.7B7.7D.5C\):_Statutory_Duty_to_Act "4.3: Actus Reus—The Criminal Act")).

### Duty to Act Based on a Contract

A duty to act can be based on a contract between the defendant and another party. The most prevalent examples would be a physician’s contractual duty to help a patient or a lifeguard’s duty to save someone who is drowning. Keep in mind that _experts_ who are _not_ contractually bound can ignore an individual’s pleas for help without committing a crime, no matter how morally abhorrent that may seem.

### Duty to Act Based on a Special Relationship

A special relationship may also be the basis of a legal duty to act. The most common special relationships are parent-child, spouse-spouse, and employer-employee. Often, the rationale for creating a legal duty to act when people are in a special relationship is the _dependence_ of one individual on another.

Parents have an obligation by law to provide food, clothing, shelter, and medical care for their children because children are dependent on their parents and do not have the ability to procure these items themselves. (However, many state legislatures passed statutes in this regard. See, e.g., the Wisconsin statute in [Example 4.3.5](Courses/Concordia_University_Wisconsin/JPP_207_Substantive_Criminal_Law/04:_The_Elements_of_a_Crime/4.03:_Actus_ReusThe_Criminal_Act#Example_.5C\(.5CPageIndex.7B5.7D.5C\):_Statutory_Duty_to_Act "4.3: Actus Reus—The Criminal Act").)

Case in Point

In  _State v._ _Williquette_ [129](https://www.google.com) [Wis.2d 239 (Wis. 1986)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13858083175089135766&hl=en&as_sdt=6,50) , Terri Williquette was charged with committing child abuse even though her husband was the person who directly committed sexual and other physical abuse of their seven-year-old son. Williquette was aware of the abuse but did take any action to prevent it. (Although the state could have charged her under § 940.34(2)(a), see [Example, 4.3.6](Courses/Concordia_University_Wisconsin/JPP_207_Substantive_Criminal_Law/04:_The_Elements_of_a_Crime/4.03:_Actus_ReusThe_Criminal_Act#Example_.5C\(.5CPageIndex.7B6.7D.5C\):_Statutory_Duty_to_Act "4.3: Actus Reus—The Criminal Act"), it did not.)  
  
The Wisconsin Supreme Court observed the general rule that other than a statutory or contractual duty, "a person generally has no [legal] duty to rescue or protect another person" from peril, even if they can render aid without danger or inconvenience. However, a parent-child relationship is a special relationship that creates a duty to protect. Also, the child abuse statute did not require a defendant to be the direct cause; it simply required a defendant's actions to "subject" the child to harm. The Court held that subjecting a child to harm includes exposing a child to a foreseeable risk of abuse. Consequently, the Court determined that Williquette's failure to protect her son from the foreseeable risk of abuse by her husband constituted the  _actus reus_ necessary to convict her of child abuse.

In addition, if someone voluntarily puts another person _in peril_, there may be a duty to _rescue_ that person.  _State ex rel. Kuntz v. Thirteenth Jud. Dist._, [995 P.2d 951](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12318759535516191060&hl=en&as_sdt=6,50 "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12318759535516191060&hl=en&as_sdt=6,50") (2000). Although this is not exactly a special relationship, the victim may be dependent on the person who created the dangerous situation because he or she may be the only one present and able to render aid. In essence, the law would treat someone who puts another peril as assuming (i.e., creating) a special relationship.

Case in Point

In  _State ex rel. Kuntz v. Thirteenth Jud. Dist._, [995 P.2d 951 (2000)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12318759535516191060&hl=en&as_sdt=6,50 "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12318759535516191060&hl=en&as_sdt=6,50")  Bonnie Kuntz stabbed Warren Becker—Kuntz's long-term live-in boyfriend—once in the chest. Kuntz did not call for medical aid. Subsequently, Becker died from the knife wound. Kuntz claimed that the stabbing was in self-defense.  
  
The Montana Supreme Court determined that despite not being married, their long-term cohabiting relationship constitutes a special relationship-based duty to aid Becker. But had the special relationship not existed, putting Becker in peril can also create a duty to summon aid. As such, Kuntz could be held criminally liable for negligent homicide for failing to summon aid if the failure to summon aid was the cause-in-fact of Becker's death, rather than the stabbing alone. (In other words, if Becker would not have died but for Kuntz's failure to summon aid, Kuntz could be liable.)

On a related note, some jurisdictions also impose a duty to _continue providing aid_ once aid or assistance has started.  Similar to the duty to rescue a victim the defendant has put in peril, the duty to continue to provide aid is rooted in the victim’s dependence on the defendant and the unlikely chance that another person may come along.

##### Exercise \(\PageIndex{9}\)

Recall the example from Chapter 1 ( [Example 1.2.1](Courses/Concordia_University_Wisconsin/JPP_207_Substantive_Criminal_Law/01:_Introduction_to_Criminal_Law/1.02:_Criminal_Law_and_Criminal_Procedure#Example_.5C\(.5CPageIndex.7B1.7D.5C\) "1.2: Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure")) in which two friends, Clara and Linda, are shopping together and Clara stands by and watches as Linda shoplifts a bra. Does Clara have a legal duty to intervene or report the crime?

**Answer**

No. Clara does _not_ have a duty to intervene or report Linda for shoplifting. First, facts do not indicate that Clara had a _contractual_ duty to report a crime because she is not a law enforcement officer or security guard obligated by an employment contract. Second, Clara does does not have a _special relationship_ with the store that would create a duty to report. Third, given that the facts do not indicate that a _statute_ or ordinance exists that requires the reporting of a crime (which is extremely unlikely anyway), Clara has no legal duty to report Linda's shoplifting.

(Of course, if Clara assists Linda with the shoplifting, she has then performed a criminal act—i.e.,  _actus reus_—and a criminal prosecution is appropriate.)

## Possession as a Criminal Act

Although it is passive rather than active, possession is still considered a criminal act. The most common objects that are criminal to possess are illegal contraband, drugs, and weapons. Some states split the crime of possession into to "theories" or categories: **actual possession** and **constructive possession**. [[2|2]](Courses/Concordia_University_Wisconsin/JPP_207_Substantive_Criminal_Law/04:_The_Elements_of_a_Crime/4.03:_Actus_ReusThe_Criminal_Act#fn2 "4.3: Actus Reus—The Criminal Act")  Generally, (1) actual possession indicates that the defendant has the item on or very near their person; and (2) constructive possession indicates that the item is not on the defendant’s person, but is within the defendant’s area of control, such as inside a house or automobile with the defendant. More than one defendant can be in possession of an object, although this would clearly be a constructive possession for at least one of them.

Because it is passive, possession should be _knowing_, meaning the defendant is aware that he or she possesses the item. [[3|3]](Courses/Concordia_University_Wisconsin/JPP_207_Substantive_Criminal_Law/04:_The_Elements_of_a_Crime/4.03:_Actus_ReusThe_Criminal_Act#fn3 "4.3: Actus Reus—The Criminal Act")  As the Model Penal Code  [§ 2.01(4)](Courses/Concordia_University_Wisconsin/JPP_207_Substantive_Criminal_Law/14:_Model_Penal_Code_Excerpts/14.02:_Article_2_Excerpts_\(General_Principles_of_Liability\)#2.01\(4\) "14.2: Article 2 Excerpts (General Principles of Liability)") states:

> Possession is an act, within the meaning of this Section, if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his possession.

---

Sidebar

Wisconsin courts sometimes use "constructive possession" as a term, but Wisconsin does not subscribe to different theories. A person is in possession of the item if they "knowingly [have] actual physical control of the item." The item may be on their person, but they also have physical control over the item if both of the following circumstances exist: (1) the item "is in an area over which the person has control" and (2) "the person intends to exercise control over the item." [[4|4]](Courses/Concordia_University_Wisconsin/JPP_207_Substantive_Criminal_Law/04:_The_Elements_of_a_Crime/4.03:_Actus_ReusThe_Criminal_Act#fn4 "4.3: Actus Reus—The Criminal Act")

---

As noted above, the crime of possession includes the element of  _knowing_—i.e., being aware of the conduct—which is unique because knowledge is otherwise a type of **criminal intent**. See  _MPC_  [2.02(b)](Courses/Concordia_University_Wisconsin/JPP_207_Substantive_Criminal_Law/14:_Model_Penal_Code_Excerpts/14.02:_Article_2_Excerpts_\(General_Principles_of_Liability\)#knowingly "14.2: Article 2 Excerpts (General Principles of Liability)").
