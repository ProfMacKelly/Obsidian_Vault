## Chapter 1 - Men Without Chests  

Lewis begins the first chapter with a critique of an English textbook which he calls The Green Book, written for "boys and girls in the upper forms of schools." **In Lewis' example, ==the authors "debunk" the sentiment that a waterfall is sublime==, claiming that such statements refer not the waterfall at all, but only to the emotions of the speaker.** Lewis **shows** that this and similar claims in *The Green Book* **==will teach school children that all statements with predicates of value are unimportant==**==.== He **shows** how **the doctrines of *The Green Book* are ==also "debunking" universal values such as honor and altruism==**, producing what he calls "men without chests."  
* *Control of Langauge *(King & Tetley, 1940): "==It is an **introduction to reading as well as to writing**, and it will not only help the apprentice writer to use words intelligently, but will assist him to adopt a more critical and discerning attitude to the wide variety of printed matter in the world of to-day.== (Publisher's Note, v)  
  
* In the preface (pp. xi- ), the ==struggles with teaching "English,"== including literature - the ==challenge with literature for the intended audience (such as Shakespeare) is like the challenge of teaching foreign policy of an early 1800s British Prime Minister. What **meaning to the reader** is there if the reader has never ridden a horse?==  
    * Little ==difference between this and the problems of implicit bias in secondary school standardized testing	==  
  
* Need fundamental and/or experience-based context to derive **meaning**. They are not talking about **meaning** in the existential sense.  
    * Good writing is about getting readers to think and feel, which is key to English literature. 	  
  
    * Chp 6 (Style),   
  
1. Why does Lewis begin with an example of a judgement of beauty, rather than an example**of a moral judgement, which seems closer to his end goal?**   
* Starting with the issue of subjectivity

2. Is Lewis correct in saying that the schoolboy who reads The Green Book will be inclined to generalize the idea that statements that contain predicates of value are unimportant, or that good literature is as meaningless as bad literature?  
  
3. Do authors like Gaius and Titius want to produce "trousered apes" and "urban blockheads," or is this an unintentional result?  
  
4. "The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts." What are the jungles and deserts to which Lewis refers? Do you agree?  
  
5. Lewis' quotes of Plato, Aristotle, and St. Augustine indicate a belief that the task of education is to train students to "feel pleasure, liking, disgust, and hatred at those things which really are pleasant, likeable, disgusting, and hateful." Do we educate our students according to this principle?  
  
6. The doctrine of objective value - can "certain attitudes [be] really true, and others really false," as Lewis suggests?  
  
7. What does it mean to be inside or outside of the Tao?  
  
8. For Gaius and Titius, what is the "useful" alternative to merely "debunking" sentiments  
such as altruism, according to Lewis? Why would one choose this alternative?  
  
9. "The head rules the belly though the chest." What are these three parts, and what is their proper function?
