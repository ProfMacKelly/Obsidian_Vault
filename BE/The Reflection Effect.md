#  The Reflection Effect   
Framing liking losing something we don’t have — Focusing on losses instead of gains  
  
You choose risky your bets when me thinking in terms of losses instead of gains.  
  
- related to prospect theory (?)

“Imagine that the US is preparing for an outbreak of an unusual disease which is expected to kill 600 people. You're an epidemiologist and you've been asked to choose between two different programs to combat the disease. The estimates about success are exact.  
  
If you choose program A, 200 people will be saved. If you choose program B, there's a one third probability that 600 people will be saved and a two thirds probability that no one will be saved. Which of the two programs would you favor?”  
  
“I'll choose option A because it seems guaranteed in comparison to option B and you know how successful it will be.  
  
I think, hmm.  
  
I'd have to go with program A because there's just a 100% probability that you can save 200 people. So it's a much better chance of actually saving some people rather than no one at all.”  
  
“Imagine that the US is preparing for an outbreak of an unusual disease which is expected to kill 600 people. You're an epidemiologist and you've been asked to choose between two different programs to combat the disease. The estimates about success are exact.  
  
If you choose program A, 400 people will die. If you choose program B, there's a 1 third probability that nobody will die and a 2 thirds probability that 600 people will die. Which of the two programs do you favor?”  
  
“I think I would have to go with option B because the chance of saving everyone is worth taking.  
  
I'm an option B guy. A is a guarantee of death. Option B is a maybe guarantee of more death, but not necessarily.  
  
So it's the optimistic choice.  
  
Did you see what happened there? If you take those two scenarios and really look at them, they're mathematically identical. 200 lives saved is the same as 400 lives lost when there are 600 lives at stake.”  
  
“And yet in the first scenario, people tend to choose the first option. 200 lives saved. And in the second scenario, they tended more often to choose the riskier second option of a one-third chance that no one would die and a two-thirds chance that everyone would die.”
