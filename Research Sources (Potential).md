Of course. This is a rich and well-developed interdisciplinary field. The resources below are categorized to help you navigate from the most directly relevant sources to broader, related publications.  
  
Core Journals Focused Specifically on Law & Behavioral Economics  
  
These journals are the primary venues for scholarship that explicitly and directly connects behavioral insights (from economics and psychology) to legal doctrine, theory, and policy.  
  
1. The Journal of Law, Economics, and Policy  
   · Focus: While broader than just behavioral economics, it frequently publishes articles at the intersection of law, economics, and other social sciences, including behavioralism. It's a key outlet for this kind of interdisciplinary work.  
2. The Journal of Legal Analysis  
   · Focus: Published by Harvard University Press, this journal features rigorous analytical work on law, often incorporating insights from behavioral economics. It is a top-tier forum for law and economics scholarship that has embraced the behavioral turn.  
3. Supreme Court Economic Review  
   · Focus: As the name suggests, it applies economic analysis to Supreme Court decisions and constitutional law. In recent years, it has featured numerous articles that use a behavioral economics lens to critique or justify the Court's reasoning.  
  
Broader Interdisciplinary Journals (Where Much of the Work is Published)  
  
Because the field is inherently interdisciplinary, many of the most influential articles appear in these broader journals.  
  
1. Journal of Empirical Legal Studies  
   · Focus: Dedicated to empirical research on law and legal institutions. Many of these studies test hypotheses generated by behavioral law and economics, such as how jurors, judges, or consumers actually behave in response to legal rules.  
2. American Law and Economics Review  
   · Focus: A premier journal for traditional and behavioral law and economics. It publishes high-level theoretical and empirical work. It is a must-read for anyone serious about the field.  
3. Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization  
   · Focus: Examines the intersection of law, economics, and political science, often focusing on institutions and organizational behavior. Behavioral insights are increasingly common here, especially concerning decision-making within firms and governments.  
  
Foundational and Related Journals in Core Disciplines  
  
The theoretical foundations and empirical evidence are often published in the top journals of the constituent fields.  
  
From Economics and Behavioral Science:  
  
· Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics (formerly the Journal of Socio-Economics): A direct source for behavioral economic models that can be applied to law.  
· American Economic Review, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Econometrica: The top general economics journals; foundational papers in behavioral economics (by Kahneman, Tversky, Thaler, etc.) and applications to public policy often appear here.  
· Judgment and Decision Making: An open-access journal focused purely on the psychological processes of judgment and choice, which is the scientific bedrock of the field.  
  
From Psychology and Law:  
  
· Law and Human Behavior: Published by the American Psychological Association, it focuses on the empirical study of how humans interact with the law (e.g., eyewitness testimony, jury decision-making, confessions). This is a crucial source for understanding the "psychology" side of the equation.  
· Psychology, Public Policy, and Law: Another APA journal that translates psychological science into policy, heavily featuring behavioral insights relevant to regulation and legal design.  
  
Key Scholarly Books and Edited Volumes  
  
These are essential for getting a comprehensive grasp of the field's theories and applications.  
  
· Foundational Texts:  
  · Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein (2008). This is the most influential popular book, but it is also a core scholarly reference.  
  · Behavioral Law and Economics (Edited by Cass R. Sunstein, 2000). This edited volume was one of the first to systematically map the terrain and is a classic.  
· Academic Textbooks & Treatises:  
  · The Cambridge Handbook of Psychology and Economic Behaviour (Edited by Alan Lewis, 2008). A comprehensive overview.  
  · Law and Mind: A Survey of Law and the Cognitive Sciences (Edited by Bartosz Brożek, et al., 2021). A more recent and very broad survey that includes excellent sections on behavioral economics.  
  
Seminal and Highly-Cited Articles to Start Your Research  
  
Any literature review should include these foundational articles.  
  
1. Korobkin, Russell B., & Ulen, Thomas S. (2000). "Law and Behavioral Science: Removing the Rationality Assumption from Law and Economics." California Law Review, 88(4), 1051-1144.  
   · Why it's important: This is the seminal article that comprehensively made the case for integrating behavioral science into law and economics, systematically challenging the model of rational choice.  
2. Jolls, Christine, Sunstein, Cass R., & Thaler, Richard. (1998). "A Behavioral Approach to Law and Economics." Stanford Law Review, 50(5), 1471-1550.  
   · Why it's important: Published slightly earlier than Korobkin & Ulen, this article by three giants in the field laid out the core framework and applications of the behavioral approach.  
3. Sunstein, Cass R. (2000). "Behavioral Law and Economics." Cambridge University Press (This is the introduction to his edited volume mentioned above, but it often stands alone as a citation).  
   · Why it's important: Provides a programmatic overview of the entire field.  
  
How to Search for More  
  
· Database Keywords: Use legal and academic databases like HeinOnline, JSTOR, SSRN, Google Scholar, and Web of Science.  
· Recommended Search Terms:  
  · "Behavioral law and economics"  
  · "Law and behavioral economics"  
  · "Bounded rationality and law"  
  · "Nudge and law"  
  · "[Specific legal topic] AND behavioral economics" (e.g., "consumer protection AND behavioral biases", "criminal sentencing AND heuristics")  
· Citation Tracing: Once you find a key article (like the ones listed above), use Google Scholar's "Cited by" function to find more recent articles that have built upon that foundation.
